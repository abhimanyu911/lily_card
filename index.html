      <h2>Hi Lily 🤍</h2>
      <p>
        Today is your final final exam, and I just needed you to pause for one second and
        <strong>gather how far you’ve come</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
         The kind where you look at this year and realize:
        you didn’t just survive it. You <strong>grew</strong>. You learned. You adapted. You kept going even when it was heavy.
      </p>

      <h2>This Year: Proof You’re Built Different</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You handled challenges</strong><br>
          The kind that would’ve made most people fold — and you're still here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You grew in ways that count</strong><br>
          Not just grades or checklists — but confidence, grit, new skills and friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You should be proud</strong><br>
          Like, genuinely proud. Not “later.” Not “after the results.” <em>Now.</em>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>For Tomorrow</h2>
      <p>
        Go in steady. Breathe. Read the questions like you own the room (because you do).
        You don’t need to be a machine (show yourself grace) — you just need to be <strong>you</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if your brain tries to throw any nonsense at you mid-exam, remember: you are <strong>prepared</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote style="margin: 1.25rem 0; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid currentColor;">
        Also, the only people saying <strong>"I'm schtoopid"</strong> will be the people who doubted you.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I’m so proud of you, Lily. Seriously. Good luck tomorrow — you’ve got this.
